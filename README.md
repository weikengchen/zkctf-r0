# Catch the flag competition over RISC Zero

This repo contains a catch-the-flag challenge in RISC Zero. 

Contestants are asked to design inputs to the guest program running inside the RISC Zero VM. The goal is to let `main.rs` output "You have successfully solved this RISC Zero challenge."

Note that this means that a correct receipt (i.e., a zero-knowledge proof) is needed in order to have RISC Zero accept the submission.

If you solve this challenge, send your solution to Weikeng Chen at w.k@berkeley.edu.
